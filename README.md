# oskar.dev

Site about some programmer. Made in React and Tailwind CSS (with JIT compilation ðŸŽ‰).

My goal was to make a simple and fast site with the techniques I know. It could have been server rendered and whatnot but I think a properly code splitted React app with preloaded assets is good stuff.
