          During the last years I have worked remotely on several frontend web
          projects. I'm comfortable taking responsibility and ownership of a
          project, finding the right tools for the job and turning requirements
          into a good user experience. While I'm not a designer myself I can
          quite easily take an rough design idea and turn it into something
          complete.
